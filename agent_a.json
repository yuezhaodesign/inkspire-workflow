  "markdown": "# Reading Scaffold Analysis: AI-Assisted Assessment of Coding Practices in Modern Code Review\n\n## Material Characteristics\n- **Content Distribution:** 80% conceptual explanations (defining code review, best practices, LLM application, system architecture), 15% visual elements (one text-based example, one system architecture diagram), 5% introductory/bibliographic information. No explicit code examples are provided in this excerpt.\n- **Key Modalities:** Primarily academic prose, supported by a text-based image (Figure 1) and a system diagram (Figure 2).\n- **Cognitive Demands:** High. Significant vocabulary density with domain-specific terms (e.g., \"modern code review,\" \"LLM,\" \"span denoising,\" \"readability mentors\"). High abstraction level, discussing system architectures and processes rather than concrete code. Requires prerequisite knowledge of software development, code review, and basic AI/ML concepts. Working memory load is moderate to high, tracking interrelationships between concepts like challenges, proposed solutions, and system components.\n- **Reading Pattern:** Primarily linear for understanding the paper's argument and background. Non-linear reading is required to interpret and integrate the visual elements (diagrams) with the surrounding prose. Reference-oriented reading is implied by numerous citations, suggesting deeper dives into related work.\n\n## Disciplinary Features\n- **Validation:** Emphasizes empirical evaluation (\"evaluation of AutoCommenter,\" \"performance and adoption,\" \"extrinsic evaluations\") and the practical impact in an industrial setting.\n- **Problem-solving approaches:** Presents a clear problem (cost/difficulty of human code review) and proposes an engineering solution (LLM-backed AutoCommenter system).\n- **Discourse markers:** Uses formal academic discourse, including explicit statements of contributions and problem-solution framing.\n- **Representation transitions:** Transitions from prose to visual representations (e.g., explaining the code review process, then showing an example comment or system architecture)."
