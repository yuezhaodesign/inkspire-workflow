  "markdown": "# Reading Scaffold Analysis: AI-Assisted Assessment of Coding Practices in Modern Code Review\n\n## Material Characteristics\n- **Content Distribution:** Approximately 70% conceptual explanations (problem, background, proposed solution, model definition), 10% visual elements (example comment, system architecture diagram), and 20% metadata/references.\n- **Key Modalities:** Primarily text, supplemented by static images (diagrams, example comment).\n- **Cognitive Demands:** High vocabulary density with domain-specific terms (e.g., \"modern code review,\" \"LLM,\" \"span denoising,\" \"readability mentors\"). Abstraction level is high, focusing on system design and processes rather than specific code. Requires prerequisite knowledge of software engineering practices and general AI/ML concepts. Moderate working memory demands to track definitions and the relationship between the problem, solution, and its components.\n- **Reading Pattern:** Primarily linear for understanding the paper's argument and background. Non-linear reading is required to integrate information from figures with the surrounding explanatory text. Reference-oriented due to numerous citations, indicating a need to consult external sources for deeper context.\n\n## Disciplinary Features\n- **Validation:** Emphasizes empirical evaluation of the system's performance and adoption in an industrial setting as a core contribution.\n- **Problem-solving Approaches:** Clearly identifies a significant problem (cost and time of human code review) and proposes an AI-driven solution (AutoCommenter using LLMs).\n- **Discourse Markers:** Uses formal academic language, with explicit statements of contributions and research questions.\n- **Representation Transitions:** Transitions from prose descriptions of complex processes and systems to visual representations (architecture diagram) and concrete examples (human code review comment)."
